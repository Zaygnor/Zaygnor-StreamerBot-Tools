Importing this will create two actions in StreamerBot.

RANDOM IMAGE SHOWER
This action will select a random image from a specified folder and set it as the source of an "Image" source in OBS. This is preferred in the images are all the same size or at least the same aspect ratio and you want them to be shown at the same size and in the same location in OBS.

RANDOM SOURCE SHOWER
This will show one of the list of provided sources from OBS. This is preferred if you need the things you are showing to have different size/location/filters/etc.
