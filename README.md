## What is this?
This repository houses Streamer.bot exports and scripts created by Zaygnor to do various things. Exports have their own readme file with minimal instructions/notes. Scripts are written as clearly as possible with comments to help you make relevant adjustments. Enjoy.


## What do these do?

### Zaygnor Random Shower
There are two functions here. The first lets you specify a folder and have a random image from the folder set as the source for an OBS "image" source. The second will show one from a list of sources in OBS. Using the second allows you to set the placement/filters/etc. of the sources independently.

### Zaygnor Spelling Bee
This set of commands let chatters add letters to a "word". Then streamer can send get the word to display on screen or send to TTS or whatever.


### Zaygnor Utilities
A collection of random one-off useful tools/actions I've created. See it's readme for the list.
